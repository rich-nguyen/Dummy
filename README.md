Dummy
========

This is solely for playing with new toys!

The original aim is that it should hold a usable project, composed of the following:
* IntelliJ IDEA project
* Various Git-based experiments
* Scala stuff
* An sbt script
* Some sh scripts for common things I used to do in windows.

Should be usable from any mac/linux system.

Steps for mac.
1. Install Homebrew
2. Install sbt, using 'brew install sbt' (check 'brew --cache' to see where it is installed).
3. Play is a dependency of the application, so simply cd into "theHackDayApp", and run the command sbt.
