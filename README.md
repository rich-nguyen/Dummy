Dummy
========

This is solely for playing with new toys!

The original aim is that it should hold a usable project, composed of the following:
* IntelliJ IDEA project
* Various Git-based experiments
* Scala stuff
* An sbt script
* Some sh scripts for common things I used to do in windows.

Should be usable from any mac/linux system.
